<h1 id="travetto-log">travetto: Log</h1>
<p>This module provides basic stdout logging via AST transformations. The code is rewritten at compile time to transform<br><code>console.(log|info|trace|warn|error)</code> into proper logging commands.  In addition to the transformation, class name and line number are added to the log messages to provide additional context.</p>
<p>Note: In production, all <code>console.(debug|trace)</code> messages are compiled away for performance/security reasons.</p>
