<h1 id="travetto-compiler">travetto: Compiler</h1>
<p>Basis for a more thorough compilation process, including source maps.  The compiler also provides the ability for handling<br>a piple of AST transformations.  The framework uses AST transformations to support it&#39;s own needs, with the reality that<br>external modules, or even project code might want to provide it&#39;s own transformations. In addition to the loading of transformations<br>the Compiler module also provides a set of utilities to enhance the transformation process.</p>
<p>Transformations are defined by <code>transformation.*.ts</code> as the filename. The schema for a transformation is </p>
<pre><code class="lang-typescript">  <span class="sx-keyword">export</span> <span class="sx-keyword">class</span> CustomerTransformer {{ "{" }}
    priority: <span class="sx-number">1</span>, <span class="sx-comment">// Lower is higher priority</span>
    phase: <span class="sx-string">'before'</span>|<span class="sx-string">'after'</span>, <span class="sx-comment">// The phase as defined by Typescript's AST processing</span>
    transformer: (context: ts.TransformationContext) =&amp;gt; {{ "{" }}
