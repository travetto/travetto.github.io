<h1 id="travetto-compiler">travetto: Compiler</h1>
<p>Basis for a more thorough compilation process, including source maps.  The compiler also provides the ability for handling
a piple of AST transformations.  The framework uses AST transformations to support it&#39;s own needs, with the reality that
external modules, or even project code might want to provide it&#39;s own transformations. In addition to the loading of transformations
the Compiler module also provides a set of utilities to enhance the transformation process.</p>
<p>Transformations are defined by <code>transformation.*.ts</code> as the filename. The schema for a transformation is </p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">  export class CustomerTransformer {
    priority: 1, // Lower is higher priority
    phase: &#39;before&#39;|&#39;after&#39;, // The phase as defined by Typescript&#39;s AST processing
    transformer: (context: ts.TransformationContext) =&gt; {
       return (file: ts.SourceFile) =&gt; file    
    }
  }</code></pre>
