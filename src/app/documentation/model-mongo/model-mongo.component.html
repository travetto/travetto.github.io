<h1 id="model-mongo">Model-Mongo</h1>
<p>This module provides access to Mongo DB, and provides easy access to a mongodb instance.  It also<br>supports saving/updating/deleting class instances, where the class instance is presumed to be the<br>name of the collection you want to store/retrieve data from .</p>
<p>It also supports convenience methods for bulk update/delete.</p>
<p>Another key feature is that it will automatically translate <code>_id</code> fields to and from <code>string</code> types to <code>ObjectId</code><br>without the developer needing to think about the state. </p>
