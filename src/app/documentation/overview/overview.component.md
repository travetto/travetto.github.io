Framework Overview
====

The goal of the framework is to provide a holistic application platform with the a focus on interactive development.

## Philosophy
The framework relies up five key principles:
* **Typescript as a development platform.**  This means the framework is intimately tied
  to typescript and it's compiler.
* **Code over configuration.**  This means that the framework prefers meta-programming via decorators
 over configuration.  Code is always the best place to define configuration.
* **Do not ask the developer to duplicate information.**  Specifically, source code transformation (and analysis) is a key element of providing seamless functionality while requiring as little as possible from the person using the framework.
* **Strive for a minimal footprint.**  When libraries are considered, an overarching goal is to
  keep the size and quantity of dependencies and functionality to a minimum.  The net result
  should be as little code as possible, and as few dependencies as possible.
* **Development responsiveness is paramount.**  The framework should
  aim for instant feedback when possible to minimize the time between making a change and
  seeing it.
