<h1 id="framework-overview">Framework Overview</h1>
<p>The goal of the framework is to provide a holistic application platform with the a focus on interactive development.</p>
<h2 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h2>
<p>The framework relies up five key principles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Typescript as a development platform.</strong>  This means the framework is intimately tied<br>to typescript and itâ€™s compiler.</li>
<li><strong>Code over configuration.</strong>  This means that the framework prefers meta-programming via decorators<br>over configuration.  Code is always the best place to define configuration.</li>
<li><strong>Do not ask the developer to repeat information.</strong>  Specifically, source code transformation (and analysis) is a key element of providing seamless functionality while requiring as little as possible from the person using the framework.</li>
<li><strong>Strive for a minimal footprint.</strong>  When libraries are considered, an overarching goal is to<br>keep the size and quantity of dependencies and functionality to a minimum.  The net result<br>should be as little code as possible, and as few dependencies as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Development responsiveness is paramount.</strong>  The framework should<br>aim for instant feedback when possible to minimize the time between making a change and<br>seeing it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="modules">Modules</h2>
<p>Every module within the framework follows the overarching philosophy.  For the most part each<br>module is as isolated as possible.  </p>
