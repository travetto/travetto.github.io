  <h1>What is Travetto?</h1>
  <p class="intro">
    Travetto is a Typescript framework for building NodeJS applications. It has a unique architecture focused on an interactive development process.
  </p>

      <h2>Interactive Development</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Writing code is hard.</strong> The time between saving your code, and being able to use it is crucial. The longer the delay, the slower the development process. Travetto solves this by tightly integrating into the underlying frameworks.
        This tight integration allows for live reloading of all code at run time.

        <em>No need to restart your server to see changes applied.</em>
